# Task5_Kaiburr
Overview
This project involves the implementation of a multi-class text classification system. The main objectives include conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), performing feature engineering, pre-processing text data, selecting and training a multi-class classification model, comparing model performance, evaluating the models, and making predictions.

1. Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
In the initial phase, the data underwent extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics. Feature engineering was employed to enhance the information available for training the model. Specific attention was given to creating meaningful features and ensuring they contribute effectively to the classification task.

2. Text Pre-Processing
The text data was subjected to thorough pre-processing steps to prepare it for the subsequent modeling phase. This included tokenization, handling missing values, and converting text into a format suitable for machine learning models. Additionally, techniques like stemming or lemmatization might have been applied to normalize the text.

3. Selection of Multi-Classification Model
Various multi-class classification models were considered for this project. The choice of models included [mention the models you considered, e.g., Random Forest, LinearSVC, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression]. Each model was evaluated based on its ability to handle the specific requirements of the classification task.

4. Comparison of Model Performance
The selected models were trained on the pre-processed data, and their performances were compared using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model in the context of the project.

5. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated on both training and testing datasets to ensure they generalize well to unseen data. Cross-validation or a separate validation set might have been used to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

6. Prediction
After selecting the best-performing model, it was used to make predictions on new or unseen data. The predictions can be used for various applications, such as classifying text into predefined categories or labels.
